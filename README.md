# Calculating Real World Object Dimensions from Kinect v1 Image Using Dynamic Resolution #

### What is this repository for? ###
The repository is the front end GUI of calculating real world dimensions of objects in the depth image using Kinect v1, using Matlab

Details of the working of the above algorithms can be found from our publication:
[Calculating Real World Object Dimensions from Kinect RGB-D Image Using Dynamic Resolution](https://doi.org/10.1109/IBCAST.2015.7058504)

### Dataset for testing ###

The code was tested on the objects found in the following [Freiberg RGB-D SLAM Datasets](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download) 
* Sequence 'freiburg3_cabinet'
* Sequence 'freiburg1_xyz'

### Hardware and Software requirements? ###

The following software’s are required for use
* Matlab 2014b and above

Note: This application is only meant to run with data acquired from Kinect for Xbox 360 or Kinect V1
